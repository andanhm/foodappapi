### Tech
Food App uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework
* [MongoDB] - MongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program

### Installation - Testing

* Clone the branch from [Stash](https://github.com/andanhm/foodappapi.git).
* Install RabbitMQ, MongoDB, and Redis.
* Config the all the server details into one of the `config file`.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd foodappapi\src
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
