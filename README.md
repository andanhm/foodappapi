# Food App API using NodeJS
> This is a my Food App API for my android application. 

How the process get starts:

### Environment settings

To run the project in development mode (environment: development), you need to configure environment variable in your startup file (like **.bash_profile** or **.profile**)

```
$ npm start
```
### Version

The below will get you project version number and the project name

```curl
$ curl -X GET -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" "http://localhost:9010/foodapp/version"
```
**Response**

```json
{
  "app": "foodapp-api",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```
# User APIs
All the APIs that are explose can be found in `routes->user.js`.

## HTTP Response code

Current API entry format:

| HTTP Status Code | Description |
| --- | --- |

| Bad Request (400) | The service is unable to understand and process the request. |
| Not Found (404) | No results were found (on a search request), or object specified in URI does not exist. |
| Bad Request (422) | The request is well formed, but was unable to be completed or validated due to business logic constraints, missing data, etc.  |
| Internal Server Error (500) | The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request. |

## HTTP Response
```json
{
  error:{
    code: 1, 
    errSource: "userCtrl",
    function: "", 
    message: "",
    description: "",

| message | Message of the error |
| description | Detail description of the error message |
| time |  Error occurred time in ISO format  |
| data | Valid Response information |
| version | Determains the API version from the package version |

## Unit Test
### Mocha
Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js
Allows unit test all the system APIs

```sh
$ npm test
```


## Loadtest Script
### Artillery
Artillery is a simple but powerful load testing toolkit.

```sh
$ sudo npm install -g artillery
```

**Create user**

```sh
$ artillery run user-create.json
```
Artillery scripts folder structure

```
- scripts /
    |__ artillery /
        |__ create /
            |__ paload.csv
	    |__ user-create.json
```

### Postman
Postman Food APP API collection

```

### Tech
Food App uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework
* [MongoDB] - MongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program
* [mongoosejs] - elegant mongodb object modeling for node.js
* [JWT] - JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties.

### Development tech
Food App uses a number of open source projects to make development faster, efficient and automat the build process:

* [ESLint] - A pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript. Maintain your code quality with ease.!
* [Gulp] - Gulp is a toolkit for automating painful or time-consuming tasks in your development workflow, so you can stop messing around and build something.
* [Mocha] - A test framework running on node.js and the browser which runs tests serially, mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases.
* [Nodemon] - Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server.
* [Should] - should is an expressive, readable, framework-agnostic assertion library.
* [Supertest] - Super-agent driven library for testing node.js HTTP servers using a fluent API

### Development tool 
* [Visual Studio Code] - Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, Mac and Linux.
* [Postman] - A powerful GUI platform to make your API development faster & easier, from building API requests through testing, documentation and sharing.
* [RoboMongo] - Native and cross-platform MongoDB manager

### Installation - Testing

* Clone the branch from [Stash](https://github.com/andanhm/foodappapi.git).
* Install RabbitMQ, MongoDB, and Redis.
* Config the all the server details into one of the `config file`.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd foodappapi\src
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### For development build we can use gulp
Install the gulp command

```sh
$ npm install --global gulp-cli
```

Runs run gulp automatically rebuilds and check for eslint code quality

```sh
$ gulp
```
